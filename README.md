# SEAFORM (SEAsonal FORecasts Management platform)

Seasonal forecasts are attracting attentions since the 2000s. Unlike forecasts at shorter timescales, 
which aim to predict individual events, seasonal forecasts aim at predicting medium-and long-term periods 
up to 7 months (Arnal et al., 2018). 

These forecasts hold the potential for being of great value for a wide range of stakeholders 
who are affected by the climate and who would benefit from understanding and better managing 
climate‚Äêrelated risks (Bruno Soares et al., 2016).

In order to apply this technology in practice, you should assess its skill first. 
This code is developed to support you to manage seasonal forecasts datasets more easily and effectively. 
It enables you to download seasonal forecasts datasets, extract them as time-series, and analyse them 
with bias correction and skill assessment by using CRPSS (Continuous Ranked Probability Skill Score) method.

Thus, this code is comprised of 4 parts;

Let's start by downloading all the Jupyter Notebook files and folders (util, assessment)

Now, this code is provisionally opened, so modification and update is still on going.
