# SEAFORM (SEAsonal FORecasts Management platform)

Since the 2000s, seasonal forecasts have gained significant attention. Unlike short-term forecasts, which predict individual events, seasonal forecasts aim to predict medium- to long-term periods of up to 7 months (Arnal et al., 2018).

These forecasts can be extremely valuable for a wide range of stakeholders affected by climate, helping them to understand and better manage climate-related risks (Bruno Soares et al., 2016). For example, this forecasting technology can predict future precipitation, temperature, and runoff, allowing for early warnings of disasters such as droughts and heat/cold waves.

 * Additionally, this code can be linked to our SEAsonal FLOW forecasts platform (SEAFLOW). Seasonal meteorological forecast data (such as precipitation, temperature, etc.) obtained from SEAFORM can be easily and efficiently translated into flow forecasts using SEAFLOW (https://github.com/uobwatergroup/seaflow).

To effectively use seasonal forecasts, their accuracy and reliability must be assessed and validated. This code is designed to help you manage seasonal forecast datasets more easily and effectively. It enables you to download seasonal forecast datasets, extract them as time series, and analyze them with bias correction and skill assessment using the CRPSS (Continuous Ranked Probability Skill Score) method.
